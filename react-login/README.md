# React Login Example

## Separation of Concerns

This is a small example of how an app can be separated into three distinct concerns.

### What am I?

JSX

### What do I look like?

CSS

### What do I do?

JavaScript


## Fetch View Presenter (FVP)

I'm using a modified version of Model View presenter that I call FVP or
Fetch View Presenter. 

`LoginForm` is the view

`useLoginForm` is the presenter

`login` is the fetch call
